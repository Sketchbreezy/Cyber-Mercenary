## Rate Limiting Implementation (Phase 3)

### What was done
- Implemented API rate limiting using `slowapi` library
- Added per-endpoint rate limits based on sensitivity:
  - Expensive operations (scans, on-chain txs): 5-10/min
  - Moderate (signing, verification): 30/min
  - Light (health, stats): 60-200/min
- Fixed slowapi Request parameter issues (needed explicit Request param for decorator)
- All endpoints tested and working

### Key Files
- `agent/src/api/server.py` - Rate limiting added

### Git Commit
- `a0a5b44` - feat: Add rate limiting for production hardening

### Next Phase 3 Tasks
1. Test Suite (Echidna + Slither for Solidity)
2. Security Audit Preparation
3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
4. Monitoring/Alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)

### Notes
- Server runs on port 8000
- Rate limit response includes `retry_after` header info
- Memory limit check needed after each edit
